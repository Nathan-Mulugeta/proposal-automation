## Proposal

### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.
This is changed now

### What is the root cause of that problem?
The root cause of this problem is here on these two lines:
https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/07b99243ad9a2fe09e857038c80e1c5d6a426d6d/src/components/MoneyRequestConfirmationList.js#L554

and 
https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/07b99243ad9a2fe09e857038c80e1c5d6a426d6d/src/components/MoneyRequestConfirmationList.js#L576

We are checking if it is a request type before rendering the right arrow. 

### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?
We can remove the check for the request type by changing this line of code: 
```javascript
shouldShowRightIcon={!props.isReadOnly && isTypeRequest} 
```

To:
```javascript
shouldShowRightIcon={!props.isReadOnly} 
```

### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)
NA
